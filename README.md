# roboter

roboter automates your build.

![roboter](https://github.com/thenativeweb/roboter/raw/master/images/logo.jpg "roboter")

## Installation

### As Node.js module

    $ npm install roboter gulp

Please note that this module depends on a *locally* installed gulp which *must* be a direct dependency of your application. Hence make sure that you always run the above command to install both modules.

### As CLI

    $ npm install -g roboter

## Quick start

First you need to create a `roboter.js` file in your application's directory. Inside that file you need to reference the module, define the environment you are working in, and run `start`.

```javascript
'use strict';

const roboter = require('roboter');

roboter.
  workOn('server').
  start();
```

This already allows you to run some pre-defined tasks, e.g. code-analysis. For that run the `bot` CLI tool and provide `analyze` as parameter.

```bash
$ bot analyze
```

By default, the pre-defined tasks use a default configuration. Most probably you want to change it. To do so, use the `equipWith` function and setup the desired tasks. Please note that the actual configuration is of course task-dependent.

```javascript
'use strict';

const roboter = require('roboter');

roboter.
  workOn('server').
  equipWith(task => {
    task('universal/analyze', {
      src: [ '**/*.js', '!node_modules/**/*.js' ]
    });
  }).
  start();
```

If you want to get an overview of all available tasks, simply run `bot` without any parameters.

```bash
$ bot
```

## Running the build

This module can be built using itself. For that install roboter globally and run it with the `build` command.

    $ bot build
